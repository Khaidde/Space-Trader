# Space Trader Remix
# About
Java/Javafx Game based on the old game Space Trader. For more information about the original game, visit http://www.spronck.net/spacetrader/STFrames.html
# How to run on Visual Studio
Step 1: Make sure files are under 1 folder. Sometimes when downloading, it will create nested folders which can cause problems when running.

Step 2: Go into extensions in Visual Studio Preferences and make sure Java Extension Pack is installed.
Step 3: For Javafx environment, watch this video in its entirety: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H67COH9F718. It contains lots of individual steps which are very important. The folder should already contain javafx SDK, but I recommend just following the video and download the SDK in your own preferred location.
